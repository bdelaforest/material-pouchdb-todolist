# Material PouchDB TodoList

Todo list using angular material UI and PouchDB/CouchDB for data persistance

Work in progress...

[Demo](https://bdelaforest.github.io/)

[Edit 2018-05-23]: ⚠️The demo only works locally as the provider _irisCouch_ doesn't exist anymore.


## About

- This app uses PouchDB for local storage, and replicates data to a CouchDB hosted on iriscouch.
- It has an .appcache file to persist all needed files for an offline usage.

- UI is based on [https://material.angularjs.org](material.angularjs.org).
